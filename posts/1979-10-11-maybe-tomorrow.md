:title Maybe Tomorrow
:author Terry Bush

There’s a voice that keeps on calling me<br />
Down the road is where I’ll always be
~~

Every stop I make, I’ll make a new friend<br />
Can’t stay for long, just turn around and I’m gone again.

Maybe tomorrow, I’ll want to settle down,<br />
Until tomorrow, I’ll just keep moving on.

Down this road, that never seems to end,<br />
Where new adventure, lies just around the bend.

So if you want to join me for a while<br />
Just grab your hat, come travel light – that’s hobo style.

Maybe tomorrow, I’ll want to settle down,<br />
Until tomorrow, the whole world is my home.

So if you want to join me for a while<br />
Just grab your hat, come travel light – that’s hobo style.

Maybe tomorrow, I’ll want to settle down,<br />
Until tomorrow, I’ll just keep moving on.

[Instrumental Bridge]

Maybe tomorrow, I’ll want to settle down,<br />
Until tomorrow, I’ll just keep moving on.

There’s a world, that’s waiting to unfold,<br />
A brand new tale, no one has ever told,

We’ve journey’d far but, you know it won’t be long,<br />
We’re almost there and we’ve paid our fare, with the hobo song.

Maybe tomorrow, I’ll want to settle down,<br />
Until tomorrow, I’ll just keep moving on.

So if you want to join me for a while<br />
Just grab your hat, come travel light – that’s hobo style.

Maybe tomorrow, I’ll find what I call home<br />
Until tomorrow, you know I’m free to roam.
